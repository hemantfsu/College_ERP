## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup (2 minutes)

Run these SQL files in order:

1. **fix-rls-policies.sql** (30 sec)
   - Fixes infinite recursion error
   - Simplifies RLS policies
   - Makes database accessible

2. **add-missing-tables.sql** (30 sec)
   - Creates courses table (5 sample courses)
   - Creates hostel_rooms table (10 sample rooms)
   - Creates hostel_allocations table
   - Creates fee_payments table
   - Adds missing columns (aadhaar, gender, blood_group)

**How to run:**
```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Click SQL Editor
3. Copy SQL file content
4. Paste and Run
5. See "Success" message
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup (1 minute)

Update `.env.local`:

```env
# Required
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional (set to false for now)
VITE_SMS_ENABLED=false
VITE_B2_ENABLED=false
VITE_RAZORPAY_ENABLED=false
```

Get credentials from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API

### Step 3: Test (3 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Go to `/public-admission`
2. Submit test application
3. See success message with Application ID
4. Go to Supabase → admissions table → See your data
5. Go to `/admissions` (Clerk Dashboard)

    const data = await studentService.getAll();
    setStudents(data);
  };
  loadStudents();
}, []);
```

### Priority 2: Connect Fee Collection (15 min)
**File:** `src/pages/FeeCollection.tsx`
