-- ================================================================
-- IMPORTANT NOTES
-- ================================================================
-- These simplified policies allow all authenticated users to access data.
-- This is fine for development and testing.
-- 
-- For production, you would want to implement proper role-based access
-- using a different approach (e.g., storing roles in JWT claims or using
-- a separate roles table that doesn't reference users).
-- 
-- The key is to avoid policies that query the same table they're on
-- or create circular dependencies.
-- ================================================================

-- ================================================================
-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
-- ================================================================
-- If you see this message, the policies have been fixed!
-- Try submitting the admission form again - it should work now.
