## ⚠️ Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

### VS Code CSS Validator Warnings:
- Issue: "Unknown at rule @tailwind"
- Issue: "Unknown at rule @apply"
- **Impact:** None - these are valid Tailwind directives
- **Solution:** Already configured `.vscode/settings.json` with `"css.validate": false`

### TypeScript Module Resolution:
- Issue: "Cannot find module './App.tsx'"
- Issue: "Cannot find module './pages/Admissions'"
- **Impact:** None - modules exist and import correctly at runtime
- **Solution:** TypeScript needs time to resolve, restart TS server if needed

### Unused Variable:
- Issue: `setExams` declared but not used
- **Impact:** None - needed for future exam CRUD operations
- **Solution:** Will be used when exam creation features are added
