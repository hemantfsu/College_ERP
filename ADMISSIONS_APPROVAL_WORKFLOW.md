### 2. Integration with Clerk Dashboard

#### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedApplication, setSelectedApplication] = useState<any>(null);
const [admissionQueue, setAdmissionQueue] = useState([...]);
```

#### Complete Application Data
Each application now includes:
- Basic info: id, name, course, date, status
- Contact: email, phone, address
- Academic: previousSchool, percentage, dob
- Guardian: guardianName, guardianPhone

**Sample Data:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'APP-2025-1001',
  name: 'Rajesh Kumar',
  email: 'rajesh.k@email.com',
  phone: '+91-9876543210',
  dob: '2005-03-15',
  address: '123 MG Road, Bangalore',
  course: 'B.Tech CSE',
  date: '2025-10-01',
  status: 'Pending',
  previousSchool: 'Delhi Public School',
  percentage: 92.5,
  guardianName: 'Mr. Kumar',
  guardianPhone: '+91-9876543211'
}
```

#### Approval Workflow Functions

**1. handleProcessAdmission**
```typescript
const handleProcessAdmission = (application: any) => {
  setSelectedApplication(application);
  setActiveModal('approval');
};
```
- Opens approval modal with selected application
- Passes complete application object

**2. handleApprove**
```typescript
const handleApprove = (id: string, remarks?: string) => {
  // Update application status to 'Approved'
  setAdmissionQueue(prev => 
    prev.map(app => 
      app.id === id ? { ...app, status: 'Approved' } : app
    )
  );
  
  // Add success notification
  addNotification({...});
  
  // Show confirmation alert
  alert('‚úÖ Application Approved!');
};
```
- Updates application status in state
- Adds notification to system
- Shows success confirmation
- **Real-time UI update**: Status badge changes immediately

**3. handleReject**
```typescript
const handleReject = (id: string, reason: string) => {
  // Update application status to 'Rejected'
  setAdmissionQueue(prev => 
    prev.map(app => 
      app.id === id ? { ...app, status: 'Rejected' } : app
    )
  );
  
  // Add error notification
  addNotification({...});
  
  // Show rejection confirmation
  alert('‚ùå Application Rejected');
};
```
- Updates application status in state
- Adds notification to system
- Shows rejection confirmation with reason
- **Real-time UI update**: Status changes across all views

### Layout Sections
Each information section has:
- **Icon**: Visual identifier (User, Book, etc.)

## üìä Real-Time Updates

### Immediate State Changes
When an application is approved or rejected:

1. **Dashboard Queue**:
   - Application removed from pending list
   - Counter updates automatically
   - Status badge color changes

2. **Detail Modal**:
   - Status column updates
   - "Process" button disappears
   - Status summary cards recalculate

3. **Admin Dashboard** (future):
   - Statistics refresh
   - Application status distribution updates

### Notification System
Both approval and rejection trigger notifications:

```typescript
addNotification({
  id: `notif-${Date.now()}`,
  type: 'success' | 'error',
  message: 'Application ${id} has been approved/rejected',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  read: false
});
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ApprovalModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;                    // Controls visibility
  onClose: () => void;                // Close handler
  application: ApplicationDetails | null;  // Application data
  onApprove: (id: string, remarks?: string) => void;
  onReject: (id: string, reason: string) => void;
}
```

### Application Details Interface
```typescript
interface ApplicationDetails {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  course: string;
  date: string;
  status: string;
  dob?: string;
  address?: string;
  guardianName?: string;
  guardianPhone?: string;
  previousSchool?: string;
  percentage?: number;
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Modal control
const [activeModal, setActiveModal] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Selected application
const [selectedApplication, setSelectedApplication] = useState<any>(null);

// Application list with live updates
const [admissionQueue, setAdmissionQueue] = useState([...]);
```

### Async Processing Simulation
```typescript
const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false);

const handleApprove = async () => {
  setIsProcessing(true);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Simulate API
  onApprove(application.id, remarks);
  setIsProcessing(false);
  // ...
};
```
